Q1: 1.	Differentiate between random and stratified sampling?
Ans. Simple random sample is used to represent the entire data population and randomly selects individuals from the population without any other consideration.
Stratified random sample, on the other hand, first divides the population into smaller groups, or strata, based on shared characteristics.
